### Library for writing Category theory proofs in Agda.


Categories are implemented as interfaces (records in Agda).

Pretty, but mostly broken. Work in progress.

Very similar to [JLimperg/cats](https://github.com/JLimperg/cats). You may wanna check that out if you want more advanced constructions.
